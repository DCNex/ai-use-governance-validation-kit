### Overview
This repository provides a **design-level governance and validation framework**
for enterprise AI / LLM adoption, with a strong focus on **auditability, risk control,
and operational readiness**.

The goal is to ensure that AI is **usable, controllable, and accountable**
before scaling into production environments.

---

### Why this exists
In many enterprises, AI initiatives fail not at the model layer,
but due to issues such as:
- unclear usage boundaries
- weak data classification and handling rules
- lack of validation and human-in-the-loop controls
- missing audit trails and monitoring mechanisms

This kit addresses those gaps by focusing on **pre-implementation governance**
and **decision accountability**.

---

### What this kit covers
- AI usage scope definition and redlines  
- Data classification and handling rules  
- Use case intake and approval workflow  
- Validation criteria and human-in-the-loop design  
- Audit trail and logging requirements  
- Monitoring, alerts, and root-cause analysis (RCA)  
- Rollout and change management  

---

### What this kit is NOT
- Not a model training or MLOps guide  
- Not a vendor-specific implementation  
- Not legal advice or a compliance replacement  

This repository focuses on **governance design and ownership**, not execution code.

---

### Intended audience
- AI PM / Solution Owner  
- Data Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) teams  
- Internal Audit and Information Security  
- Enterprise transformation and operations leaders  

---

### Status & scope
This is a **design-level, pre-implementation framework**.

Each section explicitly distinguishes between:
- validated practices (based on real enterprise constraints), and  
- conceptual designs (clearly marked where implementation is pending).
